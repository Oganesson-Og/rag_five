Includes integers, terminating decimals (e.g., 0.5), and recurring decimals (e.g., 0.333...). \n- **Irrational Numbers:** Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction (e.g., π, √2). Their decimal representations are non-terminating and non-recurring.\n- **Real Numbers (R):** All rational and irrational numbers combined."

All other sets in that context are subsets of the universal set.\n- **Finite Set:** A set with a countable number of elements (either zero or a specific positive integer). Example: {1, 2, 3}.\n- **Infinite Set:** A set with an unlimited number of elements; they cannot be counted. Example: The set of natural numbers {1, 2, 3, ...}.\n- **Null or Empty Set (∅ or {}):** A set containing no elements. Example: The set of elephants that can fly. n(∅) = 0.\n- **Equal Sets:** Two sets A and B are equal (A = B) if and only if they contain exactly the same elements, regardless of order. Example: {1, 2, 3} = {3, 1, 2}.\n- **Subset (⊆):** Set A is a subset of set B (A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also an element of B. Example: If A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2, 3}, then A ⊆ B. The empty set is a subset of every set (∅ ⊆ A).\n- **Proper Subset (⊂):** Set A is a proper subset of set B (A ⊂ B) if A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B (i.e., B contains at least one element not in A). Example: Using A and B above, A ⊂ B.\n- **Union of Sets (∪):** The union of sets A and B (A ∪ B) is the set containing all elements that are in A, or in B, or in both. Example: If A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}, then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3}.\n- **Intersection of Sets (∩):** The intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B) is the set containing all elements that are common to both A and B. Example: If A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}, then A ∩ B = {2}."
