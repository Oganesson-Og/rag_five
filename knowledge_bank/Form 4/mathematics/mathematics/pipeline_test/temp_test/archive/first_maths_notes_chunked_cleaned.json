How do you find the number a?\nFrom theory logarithm $\\quad \\log _{10} \\mathrm{a}=0,8326$\n\n$$\na=10^{0,8326}\n$$\n\nSince its difficult to simplify $10^{0,8326}$ the solution can be easily be found by looking for the antilogarithm on such tables.\nWhen finding an antilog, we look up the fractional part only in antilog tables. Then use the integer to place the decimal correctly in the final number. How? We simply add 1 to the integer to get the number of digit before the comma thus $1+1=2$ digits before comma. When the integer is for example 2 . All bars are treated as negative numbers thus $-2+1=-1$ thus 0,0 non-zero digit, -3 means 0,00 non-zero digit which could be $0,01250,0,00125$ and 0,000125 respectively.\n\nLike in finding logarithms add the difference."

How do you calculate the distance travelled by the car.\n\n\n## Stage OA\n\nIn this stage the car is said to be accelerating. Acceleration is the rate of change of speed with time. Since OA describes a straight it means the car was accelerating at a uniform speed. Its speed started from the rest at O and changes by the same quantity every second until it reached a speed of $\\mathrm{Vm} / \\mathrm{s}$ after $\\mathrm{t}_{1}$, seconds. The gradient of OA , therefore, gives the acceleration.\n\nAcceleration $=$ change in speed Change in time\n\nThe units of acceleration are $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n# Stage AB \n\nIn stage AB of the graph the car is moving at a constant speed $\\mathrm{Vm} / \\mathrm{s}$. It means its speed is no longer changing, between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$, hence, the acceleration is zero. (no acceleration) Practically, the driver is just controlling the steering without applying the accelerator.\n\n## Stage BC\n\nIn stage BC of the graph there is deceleration or retardation. The driver is slowing down from a speed of $\\mathrm{vm} / \\mathrm{s}$ until the car was stopped at $t_{3}$ (i.e speed is equal to zero). Practically, between $t_{2}$ and $t_{3}$ the driver applies the brakes to stop the car. The gradient of BC is negative since there is negative acceleration, or deceleration.\n\n## Distance\n\nThe area under a speed graph gives the total distance traveled. In the diagram it can be found by recognizing the trapezium shape formed and using its area.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Area of a trapezium }=1 / 2 \\text { (sum of parallel sides) } \\mathrm{x} \\text { height } \\\\\n& 1 / 2(\\mathrm{AB}+\\mathrm{OC}) \\mathrm{V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe area can also be found by dividing the whole shape into triangle $T$, rectangle and another triangle $T_{2}$ and adding together all the three areas to get the distance."

It is a fraction which lies between 0 and 1 , which gives us an idea of likelihood of an event happening or not happening.\nIf the probability of an event is one (1) it means the event will certainly happen. If its zero (0), then it will certainly not happen."

These two events cannot happen at the same time.\nHowever, the event of getting a score of 3 and the event of getting an odd number of score are not mutually exclusive.

        "content": "# Histogram \n\nHistogram is a form of statical representation of data used for continuous data. The kind of data that we were dealing with in bar graph was discrete data. It involved counting the number of goals, cars, marks, eggs of which a fraction can not be obtained. In continuous data, if we measure for instance the height of a plant we are likely to get a measurement say between 120 and 121 cm (i.e 120,$3 ; 120 ; 8 ; 120 ; 98$ etc. In most cases the actual measurement is not exact but rounded to the nearest centimentre or millimeters. A height recorded as 120 cm could have been 120,4 or $119,7 \\mathrm{~cm}$\n\n## Grouped data\n\nWhen a variable has a large number of different values, the values are often placed in groups or class and the data is presented in a histogram\nFor example, the marks on a test may be shown in a frequency distribution table as followings\n\n| Mark x | $21-30$ | $31-40$ | $41-50$ | $51-60$ | $61-70$ | $71-80$ | $81-90$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Frequency f | 2 | 4 | 7 | 8 | 3 | 1 | 1 |\n\nAlternatively the information could be shown in inequality form as follows:\n| Mark x | $20<x \\leq 30$ | $30<x-\\leq 40$ | $30<x \\leq 40$ | $40<x \\leq 50$ | $50<x \\leq 70$ | $60<x \\leq 70$ | $70<x \\leq 80$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Frequency f | 2 | 4 | 7 | 8 | 3 | 1 | 1 |\n\nClass boundaries and class interval (class width)\nThese are prerequisite in the drawing of a histogram\nClass interval = Upper class boundary - Lower class boundary\nTaking the 21-30 class interval\nLower boundary\nUpper boundary\n\n\nAlso taking the 31-40\nLower class boundary\nUpper class boundary\n\n\nClass interval is 10 marks (i.e 41-30) or cross width\nFor continues data like the height, age, time etc remember we said a height of 21 cm could be on approximation of any value between 20,5 and $21,5 \\mathrm{~cm}$. Also 25 cm could be an approximation of any value between 24,5 and 25,5\nHence for a class of $21-25(\\mathrm{~cm})$\nLower boundary\nupper boundary\n20,5\n25,5\n\n\nFind the Mean\nTo find the mean the midpoint of the classes is use.\nDrawing a histogram with equal class widths"
