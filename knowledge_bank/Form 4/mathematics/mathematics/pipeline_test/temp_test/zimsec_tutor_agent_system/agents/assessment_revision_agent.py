ZIMSEC Tutoring System - Assessment and Revision Agent
------------------------------------------------------

This module defines the `AssessmentRevisionAgent`, an AI agent specialized in
generating practice questions, grading student submissions, and tracking their
mastery over time within the ZIMSEC Tutoring System.

Key Features:
- Generates practice question sets based on topic and difficulty.
- Grades student answers and provides feedback.
- Updates a (mock) scorecard to track student performance.
- Formats output as Markdown for user readability (questions with hidden answers, grading tables).
- Adheres to rules like randomizing numeric values and not revealing answer keys prematurely.

Technical Details:
- Inherits from `autogen.AssistantAgent`.
- Defines a system message detailing its purpose, core functions, output styles, and operational rules.
- Registers a custom reply function (`_generate_assessment_reply`) for task handling.
- Includes mock implementations for its core tool functions (`generate_questions`, `grade_answers`, `update_scorecard`).

Dependencies:
- autogen
- json
- random
- time
- typing (List, Dict, Any, Optional, Tuple, Union)
- logging

    Mock function to simulate the generation of practice questions.

    drawing from a question bank, using templates, or even employing another LLM

        difficulty (str): The difficulty level (e.g., "easy", "medium", "hard").

        Handles incoming messages to generate questions or grade answers.

        It then calls the appropriate mock tool function and formats the response
        as a Markdown string suitable for display to the user.

        - For "generate_questions", it can include "topic", "difficulty", and "n" (number of questions).
