ZIMSEC Tutoring System - Curriculum Alignment Agent
---------------------------------------------------

This module defines the `CurriculumAlignmentAgent`, an AI agent responsible for
ensuring that all interactions and content within the ZIMSEC Tutoring System
are strictly aligned with the official ZIMSEC syllabus for O-Level Mathematics
and Combined Science.

Key Features:
- Receives user queries and context (subject, form level) from the Orchestrator.
- Utilizes the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline to check the query
  against the syllabus data stored in a vector database.
- Returns a structured JSON response to the Orchestrator, detailing:
    - Whether the query is in the syllabus.
    - Alignment score.
    - Matched learning outcomes.
    - Mandatory terminology.
    - Identified subject, topic, subtopic, and form.
    - Any identified gaps or notes for the Orchestrator.

Technical Details:
- Inherits from `autogen.ConversableAgent`.
- Defines a system message that outlines its responsibilities, communication
  guidelines, tool usage (RAG via `get_syllabus_alignment_from_rag`), and integrity rules.
- Registers a custom reply function (`_generate_alignment_reply`) to handle incoming
  requests and interact with the RAG system.
- Loads syllabus data (for reference or fallback, though primary alignment is via RAG).

Dependencies:
- autogen
- json
- asyncio
- os
- typing
- logging
- ../rag_integration.py (get_syllabus_alignment_from_rag)
- ../../mathematics_syllabus_chunked.json (for reference/fallback)

    The CurriculumAlignmentAgent is responsible for aligning student queries
    with the official ZIMSEC syllabus using a RAG-based approach.

    It receives a student's query along with context (like subject and form level hints)
    from the OrchestratorAgent. Its primary task is to determine how this query maps
    to the syllabus. This involves:
    1.  Passing the query and context to the `get_syllabus_alignment_from_rag` function
        from the `rag_integration` module. This function interacts with a RAG pipeline
        (which typically includes a vector store of syllabus documents and an embedding model)
        to find the most relevant syllabus entries.
    2.  Receiving a structured dictionary from the RAG function containing detailed
        alignment information (e.g., matched outcomes, topic, subtopic, score).
    3.  Formatting this dictionary into a JSON string.
    4.  Returning this JSON string as its reply to the OrchestratorAgent.

    The agent's system prompt guides its behavior, emphasizing strict adherence to
    syllabus outcomes, proper JSON output format, and read-only access to the RAG tools.
    It is designed to be a specialized component focused solely on curriculum alignment,
    providing crucial data for downstream agents to tailor their responses accurately.

        """
        Processes an incoming query from the Orchestrator to perform syllabus alignment.

        This asynchronous method is triggered when the agent receives a message.
        It expects the message content to be a JSON string containing:
        -   `user_query`: The student's question.
        -   `learner_context`: A dictionary that can include:
            -   `current_subject_hint`: The subject the query is likely related to (e.g., "Mathematics").
            -   `current_form_level_hint`: The student's current form level (e.g., "Form 4").

        The method performs the following steps:
        1.  Parses the incoming JSON to extract `user_query`, `subject_hint`, and `form_level_hint`.
        2.  Calls the `get_syllabus_alignment_from_rag` function, passing these extracted values.
            This function interacts with the RAG pipeline to get syllabus alignment details.
        3.  The result from `get_syllabus_alignment_from_rag` (a dictionary) is converted
            into a JSON string.
        4.  This JSON string is then returned as the content of the agent's reply.

        Error handling is included for JSON decoding errors or other exceptions during processing,
        returning an error JSON in such cases.

        Args:
            *args: Variable length argument list (potentially including the agent instance).
            **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments. Expected to contain:
                - `messages` (List[Dict]): A list of messages. The last message's content
                  is parsed for the query and context.
                - `sender` (autogen.Agent, optional): The agent that sent the message.
                - `config` (Any, optional): Configuration data (not actively used).

        Returns:
            Tuple[bool, Dict[str, str]]: A tuple where the first element is True (indicating
                                       the agent can reply), and the second element is a
                                       dictionary representing the assistant's message,
                                       with the 'content' key holding the JSON string of
