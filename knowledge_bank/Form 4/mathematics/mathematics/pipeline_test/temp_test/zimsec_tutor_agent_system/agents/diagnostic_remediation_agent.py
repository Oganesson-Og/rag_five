ZIMSEC Tutoring System - Diagnostic and Remediation Agent
---------------------------------------------------------

This module defines the `DiagnosticRemediationAgent`, an AI agent designed to
evaluate learner answers, pinpoint misconceptions, and recommend targeted
remediation steps or review of prerequisite topics within the ZIMSEC Tutoring System.

Key Features:
- Analyzes learner responses against marking rubrics (simulated).
- Identifies potential misconceptions (conceptual, procedural, careless).
- Suggests remediation actions based on the type of misconception.
- Can check for prerequisite mastery and suggest remediation if needed.
- Retrieves remediation content from syllabus data for previous form levels.
- Outputs diagnostic results and remediation suggestions in a structured JSON format.

Technical Details:
- Inherits from `autogen.AssistantAgent`.
- Defines a system message outlining its mission, workflow, constraints, and tool usage.
- Registers a custom reply function (`_generate_diagnostic_reply`) to handle diagnostic tasks.
- Includes mock implementations for core tools (`analyse_response`, `suggest_remediation`).
- Loads syllabus data (`mathematics_syllabus_chunked.json`) to find prerequisite content.

Dependencies:
- autogen
- json
- random
- os
- typing
- logging
- ../../mathematics_syllabus_chunked.json (Syllabus Data)

        Generates a diagnostic report and remediation suggestions based on a learner's answer.

        This asynchronous method is the core logic handler for the `DiagnosticRemediationAgent`.
        It processes an incoming message, which is expected to be a JSON string containing
        details about the learner's attempt at a question.

        Workflow:
        1.  Parses the input JSON to extract: `question`, `learner_answer`, `marking_rubric`,
            optional `diagnostic_check` (for prerequisites), and `alignment_data` (for context).
        2.  If a `diagnostic_check` for a prerequisite topic is present:
            a.  Analyzes the learner's answer to the prerequisite question using `analyse_response`.
            b.  If the prerequisite score is below a threshold (e.g., 0.7), it suggests
                remediation for the prerequisite topic using `suggest_remediation` and returns
                a JSON response indicating that prerequisite remediation is needed.
            c.  If prerequisite mastery is sufficient, it proceeds to the main question.
        3.  If the main question context (topic, subtopic, form) is available from `alignment_data`,
            it attempts to find relevant remediation content from previous form levels in the
            `SYLLABUS_DATA` using `get_remediation_path_from_alignment`. If found, it returns
            this syllabus content as a remediation suggestion.
        4.  If no prerequisite issue or direct syllabus remediation is triggered, it analyzes the
            learner's answer to the main `question` using `analyse_response`.
        5.  Based on the analysis score:
            a.  If the score is high (e.g., >= 0.7), it returns a JSON indicating "mastered".
            b.  If the score is low, it identifies the `misconception_type` and uses
                `suggest_remediation` to get tailored remediation steps. These are packaged
                into the JSON response.
        6.  The final JSON response (diagnostic report or error message) is returned.

        Args:
            messages (Optional[List[Dict]]): A list of messages. The last message contains
                                            the JSON payload with the diagnostic request.
            sender (Optional[autogen.Agent]): The agent that sent the message.
